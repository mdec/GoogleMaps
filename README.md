# GoogleMaps

This will hopefully become a Julia package that can accomplish the following tasks
by communicating with the Google Maps and Geocode APIs:

* geocode addresses, returning the latitude-longitude coordinates and the cleaned version of the address
* return static map images
* create JavaScript to open a dynamic map in a web browser that meets a user's specifications (center, zoom, etc.)

Use doesn't require an API key at this point, but you should get one to begin using this code.
